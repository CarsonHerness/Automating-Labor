Are human jobs all going to be replaced with robots? Will automation fundamentally reshape the economy?

The robot revolution, machines are taking our jobs—fears about the automation of previously human jobs are nothing new, but as technology has advanced leaps and bounds in the most recent decades, a new potency lends itself to these fears. Economists, in particular, worry about the impact of automation on the economy, theorizing that eventually, the jobs that machines take from humans will outpace the new human jobs that are being created. In this post, I share recent research from economists on the automation of labor, and I consider this research in the context of one job that might be at risk for automation, Uber drivers.

## Robots at Work: Automatable and Non Automatable Jobs

In "Robots at Work: Automatable and Non Automatable Jobs," Cecily Josten and Grace Lordan expand on previous work that classifies currently existing jobs as automatable or not, as well as estimating when such automation will be possible for each job. Josten and Lordan distinguish between jobs that will be automatable within the next decade (like driverless car technology on driving-based jobs) and jobs that they expect to be automatable in the coming decades.[^1] They find that "47% of jobs can be automated with technology becoming available shortly, with 35% of these being fully automatable."[^2] Their conclusions were similar to the conclusions of similar studies that looked at the percentage of jobs that will be automated. However, as the study authors note, they looked at currently existing jobs and did not consider new jobs that will be invented and created; thus, they do not conclude that all people who work in that 47% of jobs will be unemployed in the coming decade.

Another important contribution from Josten and Lordan is that they hypothesize that "people and 'thinking' (the ability to problem solve, think strategically and navigate around problems) skills are the ones that will hold value for the fourth industrial revolution."[^3] Thus, someone hoping to avoid their job being automated away might focus on "people skills" in order to have some job security.

## Revisiting the risk of automation

Like Josten and Lordan, Melanie Arntz, Terry Gregory, and Ulrich Zierahn write about the automation of labor from an economic perspective in "Revisiting the risk of automation." The authors acknowledge the rapid development in robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) that have facilitated the loss of human jobs to machines. However, the authors argue that the percentage of jobs that will be automated has been overestimated.

In the study, the authors estimate the share of jobs that will be automated in the future using a job-based approach rather than an occupation-based approach. With this analysis, the authors find that "the automation risk of US jobs drops from 38 % to 9 % when allowing for workplace heterogeneity. Occupation-level assessments of automation potentials thus are severely upward-biased."[^4] Thus, the authors predict that not as many jobs will be automated as other studies have argued, such as Josten and Lordan's study. They note that while many jobs will shift and morph in response to advancing technology and automation abilities, much fewer jobs will be completely eliminated.[^5]

## Case Study: Uber

Uber drivers is one interesting case study as an automatable or non-automatable job. Alex Rosenblat and Luke Stark write about automated and algorithm-controlled aspects of the job as Uber driver. If one considers an Uber driver's only task as driving, then their jobs would be at risk of automation in the next decade, as Josten and Lordan describe. However, driving for Uber does not just involve driving. Uber drivers must partake in the people skills that Josten and Lordan predict will be critical skills to avoid automation. As Rosenblat and Stark note, Uber drivers partake in emotional labor as part of their job.[^6] When the definition of their job is expanded to include the emotional labor that Uber drivers must partake in, then their job might fit a job that Arntz et al. described as partially becoming automated

However, Uber does not seem to agree with this sentiment—Uber is actively working on self-driving cars to use for their driving services in place of human drivers. As Rosenblat and Stark outline, Uber also automates many parts of the driving job that don't directly involve driving, like driver management and customer interactions like ratings, to the detriment of driver's job stability and well-being.[^7] As such, Uber does not seem to acknowledge the labor beyond driving that it's drivers do to maintain Uber's service.

The case of Uber illustrates the compilation of considering whether or not a job will be automated—driverless driving technology is coming to a point of fruition in the coming decade, like Josten and Lordan note, but perhaps only part of an Uber driver's job will be automated, like Arntz et al. describe for some jobs at risk of automation. However, technological advancements aren't the sole determiner for what gets automed with Uber—the app creators also determine if the driving jobs will get automated away, by choosing to ignore the human aspects of the Uber driver job. As a result, jobs such as Uber drivers may provide less of a (or maybe a different) service than before if the humans in these jobs are replaced by machines.
