Charles Babbage's impact on automation went beyond his work as the "Father of the Computer." This post outlines his impact through his technical work and his manufacturing philosophy work, as seen through his book _On the Economy of Machinery and Manufactures_.

Automation of labor is nothing new, but the rise of factories during the Industrial Revolution was a major milestone for automation. Charles Babbage, an nineteenth century philosopher, inventor, and mathematician, was an important figure for the invention of the modern factory system. Babbage is credited with many achievements, including "Father of the computer" for his work on the Analytical Engine with Ada Lovelace. Simon Schaffer is a professor of history & philosophy of science at the University of Cambridge who wrote about the connections between Babbage's engineering and factory work in "Babbage's Intelligence: Calculating Engines and the Factory System." Of course, mechanical and computational inventions have contributed to the automation of labor, augmenting or replacing previously human jobs. Schaffer quotes Henry Thomas Colebrooke, who in 1823 wrote, "Mr Babbage's invention puts an engine in place of the computer."[^1] Here, computer refers to its original definition: a job where a human performed calculations.[^2] Even in the early nineteenth century, people recognized that innovative inventions would replace jobs that had previously been limited to humans.

Babbage's impact on the automation of labor was not just limited to inventions that would replace human jobs; Babbage also helped automate or mechanize humans within their jobs through factories. In addition to his fame in the world of computer science, Babbage also had a significant impact on other facets of modern society, including the world of manufacturing. Schaffer describes Babbage as a "philosopher of manufacture" who likened factories to mechanical systems.[^3] In his successful book _On the Economy of Machinery and Manufactures_, published in 1832 with a second edition in 1833, Babbage shares the culmination of his knowledge of factory systems. Schaffer reported that its success spanned Europe, with the book being translated into every major European language.[^4]

The introduction lays out Babbage's mission: "The object of the present volume is to point out the effects and the advantages which arise from the use of tools and machines … and to trace both the causes and the consequences of applying machinery to supersede the skill and power of the human arm."[^5] Babbage himself explicitly says that he's interested in automating factory jobs with machines with the superior skill (as he sees it) of the machines, just like Colebrooke noted with the Analytical Engine in 1823.

The lasting legacy of the book, however, is with what is now known as the "Babbage Principle." Babbage describes a division of labor that would make factories more efficient, invoking principles articulated by Adam Smith:
  That the master manufacturer, by dividing the work to be executed into different processes, each requiring different degrees of skill or of force, can purchase exactly that precise quantity of both which is necessary for each process"[^6]
This concept that Babbage describes is the "Babbage Principle." Under the Babbage principle, the task of creating some product was broken down into separate subasks, allowing people and processes to specialize to each subtask. A consequence of this principle was the interchangeability of workers: with each subtask being smaller and simpler, it would be easier to switch workers in and out of that position within the factory, like a replacement part within a larger machine.

In Babbage's factories, high replaceability facilitated the exploitation of workers' labor. As Schaffer stated, Babbage's research influenced engineering managers to "allow the employment of increasingly cheap hands and increasingly subordinate labour processes."[^7] If a worker could be easily replaced, the managers were not incentivized to maintain a hospitable working environment that would encourage employees to stay. This, combined with the fact that people may not have had access to other paying jobs, meant that workers were in prime position to be exploited for their labor.

In the factories, the engineering managers (like Babbage) received the credit for the fruits of the labor of the factory workers. Schaffer connected this phenomenon with Babbage's presentation of himself as the unique author of the Analytical Engine: "They embodied his control over the engine while they disembodied the skills and camouflaged the work force on which it depended."[^8] The manager of the workers would enjoy all of the credit and benefits of their labor, just as Babbage had with those who had helped him create the Analytical Engine.

Babbage's focus on efficiency of factory processes inspired factory managers who were already hoping to increase productivity and profits; they wanted to control the workforce in the factories;[^9] as Schaffer describes, "the science of the factory was at once a means of disciplining labour."[^10] Factory managers shifted to treating workers like cogs in the machine, dehumanizing workers in the process.

The shift in factory and workers structure did not go without a hitch, as Schaffer notes: "There was thus an unresolved contradiction between stress on the subordination and thus mechanization of workers' intelligence and on the coordination and thus cerebration of their labour."[^11] Assuming that people would be willing to be mechanized within their jobs to help make the wealthy factory managers even wealthier was a bold assumption; an insight that Schaffer connects to Karl Marx's work in the same period.

Overall, Babbage's impact on automation went beyond the computer. Babbage's technical innovations contributed to the replacement of previously human jobs with machines. Babbage's manufacturing philosophy contributed to the automation and mechanization of humans within factories, which were like giant machines themselves. The consequences of these advances were dehumanizing. As Schaffer aptly states, "Under Babbage's productive gaze, the powers of the body were rendered mechanical and thus profitable, or wasteful and thus consigned to oblivion."[^12]
