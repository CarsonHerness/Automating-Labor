    bio: |
      I am a senior computer science major at Harvey Mudd College graduating in May 2021. In Spring 2021, I enrolled in the class Human and Artificial Minds to learn about the history and development of Artificial Intelligence. Through this class, I’ve learned about the history of computing, mechanization, and the ever-changing definitions of intelligence. I hope to apply lessons I’ve learned in this class to my career in software engineering.
