## Mission Statement

Humans have been concerned that machines would take their jobs for decades or longer before the 21st century, but fears and concerns capture the attention of laborers, businessmen, and legislators alike as technology continues to advance. In this blog, I explore what kind of labor is defined as automatable by different people, fields, and industries. I also hope to provide some historical context for the automation of human labor.

Oftentimes historically, the rich and powerful define what labor is valuable and what is not, and “valuable” labor is often used to distinguish between automatable labor or not. How the upper class defines intelligence is also used to determine which labor is worthy of maintaining as human labor or not. Having this historical knowledge in tandem with a workforce whose jobs will increasingly be automated can help us critically think about the human impacts of technological progress.
